# Object-Detection | Tracking | Counting

## Frame Generation

1. Run `Frame_generation/frame_generation_kaggle.ipynb` on kaggle 
2. get generated folder link at the end and copy it
3. using `kaglle_to_colab_to_drive.ipynb` on colab unzip and upload them (generated frames) directly to the google drive

## Anotation

1. Using `Frame_anotation/drive_to_colab_to_roboflow.ipynb` upload frames from google drive to roboflow
2. Anotate them using Roboflow

## Object Detection

1. Add custom dataset snipest from roboflow
2. Run `Object_detection/object_detection_kaggle.ipynb` on kaggle
3. get generated folder links at the end and copy them
4. using `kaglle_to_colab_to_drive.ipynb` on colab unzip and upload them (trained models) directly to the google drive

## Track Objects and Count

1. Run `Track_and_count/track_and_count_kaggle.ipynb` on kaggle
2. get generated file link at the end and copy it
3. using `kaglle_to_colab_to_drive.ipynb` on colab copy and upload them (output video) directly to the google drive
